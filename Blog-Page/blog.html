            <p>
                Although we can not deny that technology has brought many positive changes,
                it is necssary to acknowledge that along with positive impact its rapid growth 
                has also introduced some negative impact on human life.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we all know, technology has brought too many social platforms through which 
                humans can digitally communicate with eachother and due to this there is less 
                in-person interaction between people. People might communicate virtually more 
                often than communicating personally which may result in feelings of loneliness 
                and decrease in the quality of interactions between people.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, the rapid growth of online platforms by technology has opened new path for 
                cybercrime and cyberbullying. As a result, especially those who are young may 
                significantly suffer from psychological health. Along with this, prolonged usage
                of digital platform for work or for entertainment may cause eye strain, sleep 
                disruption and higher risk of mental health disorders including anxiety and 
                depression.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no denying that technology has greatly enhanced many aspects of our life
                but it is important to acknowledge and deal with the negative impacts as well.
